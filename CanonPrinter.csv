  I am using this printer around 3 years and faced no issues at all.It is very good for home purpose.Very comfortable to use it.No maintenance at all.Refilling of ink bit expensive but fineIf not in use better to put cover on it as it will preserve the ink and not dry it fastDouble side printing facility also available and is very easy as it gives instructions how to place the paper for double side printingScan and copy quality is very good

  I bought this printer for 4899 and i'm refilling it with cartridges for 2000. This printer wont print with Black Ink only it needs color ink as well to print. So there is no point in setting the printer to Black Only or grey scale mode. Please do not buy this product. GO for a higher end model which requires lesser maintenance. I'm totally digusted with this fact otherwise the printer is good.

  The printer works well and is value for money. Nevertheless there is a valid reason to be upset with the way Amazon has paid no heed to repeated requests to stop advertising this product as having WiFi connectivity. This is wrong in the eyes of the end-user and a bunch of lies even to the most aware consumer. Please be careful before you buy such a product. You may uphold its quality, still realizing that somewhere down the line you have been BLATANTLY CHEATED by these marketing zombies.

  It is very slow printer. For high quality black-white print it takes 03:49 seconds for a single page but in description it shows 8 pages per minute for black and 4 page per minute for color but it not reflect not at all. How long should I wait for it? And color print is also not a good quality it reflects like some small-small dots on color print out and I more thing that it shows many pages to print in single cartridge but only after 4 color pages it shows ink is in low condition, what the hell is this?Such a useless product it is.

  Great printer so far. Have used it for several scans and a couple of prints.I previously owned an HP 2515 which broke after 2 years of usage.In comparison the printing and scanning are much quieter. The scanning is very silent.The unit also looks more sophisticated than the HP in the same price range.Only downside is that a print job takes a bit longer to start than what I was previously used to with my HP. And occasionally it has trouble accepting the paper input. If that wasn't a problem, it would be 5 stars.

  Quality product... A very good deal in Amazon,  got it at Rs 3899 only!.. Well packaging, build quality is also great!  Doesn't look like cheap hp printers at all! Both colour and black prints are of good quality,  easy to install too!... All functions are wworking great, but scan resolution is only 600 dpi, when in the specifications, the are saying 1200! And please note that the package doesn't contain any kind of warranty card, while it has two years on site warranty.  Well I have checked this matter with Cannon customer service, and found that the seller had updated my purchase with Cannon, and registered it's warranty too! So u need not to worry about it!. :) you just need to show your invoice in case you need any free service from Cannon...

  This was the printer i was looking for .It is built in with many functions on the 7 segment led display.This means that you don't need to use your computer when you have to do copying(black and white ,scanning ,maintenance, paper select etc.the scan quality is mind blowing.and the the main thing that is the print it incredible because it is canon.it has two fine cartridges one black and one color price seems to be a bit high but they give reasonable number of prints per cartridge making it cheaper thank going out and taking a print out.the only thing is missing is WiFi.if you don't want to use the WiFi feature go for it. if you have little more money then you can buy canon pixma e560 which looks the same and the features are also same only difference that it has WiFi inbuilt.if you are a hp fan then forget hp and trust canon because hp service is horrible.the cartridge cost in hp is low but the no of prints is very low and print quality is bad.please trust me and buy this incredible printer !!!

  A very nice printer. Very easy to setup and use. Compatible with Mac OSX Yosemite. Print quality is fine for both black & white and colot printer. Scanning and photocopy is also very easy with buttons on the panel. Only downsides are initial time to print is high (when you switch on your printer and start printing) and does not have wifi access.Shipment from Amazon was fast. The box was nicely packed.

Just insert the CD, follow the instructions and in 10 mibnutes you are ready to print your first page.Scanning quality is good, more than avarage for Home use.now coming to printing Speed.i was amazed to see the printing speed. less than 3 second to print document. Though i am using FAST printing option the print quality is quite good.I have printed nearly 200 pages with mixed text and screenshot for my project and i was amazed to see that only 1/4 of the black ink is used.printed 20 4 x 6 photo and colour ink is still full.so PG - 88 and cl-98 rocks.go for the printer.you wont regret.
